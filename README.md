## index.html
This is the document for the home page. All content required has been completely done by me. All pages have been interlinked with each other completely.<br>
Update [02-Nov-23]: updated main -> index due to github restrictions
                    changed the background to look less dated amongst other visual changes

## aboutus.html
This is the document for the about us section. I have added a basic documentation for our website, and our names and roll numbers. So all the content has been completed by me.

## contactus.html
This is the document for the contact us section. Have used form for it. Aesthetically, it isn't looking nice. I hope you'll make it much better.<br>
Update [02-Nov-23]: Simplified and updated it to look nicer, don't touch it as it may ruin it.

## vegmenu.html
This should contain a table or list of items with images. Haven't done it. If I get the time, I'll add the content, else you will have to do it.

## nonvegmenu.html
Same case as vegmenu.html

## ordernow.html
My idea for this page is that it should be a form check-boxes for each dish to add to the order, and an ordernow button. For the order now button, instead of using the form buttons, we can create a block using div and padding etc, to make it look an appealing button and then hve it linked to a feedback page. Havent't done it yet.

## styles.css
A single CSS document for all the pages. All pages linked with this CSS file.<br>
Update [02-Nov-23]: Updated it to contain further styling for modifications made

## Other details
<ul>
<li>All the image names, class names, id names are self-explanatory in my opinion.</li>
<li>The navigation bar code has been implemented using unordered list tags in all the pages to maintain uniformity.</li>
<li>I have also added a footer in all the pages, and set it's postion fixed to bottom.</li>
<li>All body and tables have been center aligned with font Times New Roman, and the width has been set to 100% (except for form, for which width was set to 90%)</li>
<li>For making all images equal-sized in the home page, I have fixed the image size using width and height.</li>
</ul>


Color distribution (as per the pallete you sent) used by me is as follows:
<ul>
<li>for background, the blue color.</li>
<li>for text, the white color.</li>
<li>for nav bar, and footer, the grey-black color.</li>
<li>and for the hovers, the black color.</li>
</ul>
