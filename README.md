# CS103 Group Project Website

## main.html
This is the document for the home page. All content required has been completely done by me. All pages have been interlinked with each other completely.

## aboutus.html
This is the document for the about us section. I have added a basic documentation for our website, and our names and roll numbers. So all the content has been completed by me.

## contactus.html
This is the document for the contact us section. Have used form for it. Aesthetically, it isn't looking nice. I hope you'll make it much better.

## vegmenu.html
This should contain a table or list of items with images. Haven't done it. If I get the time, I'll add the content, else you will have to do it.

## nonvegmenu.html
Same case as vegmenu.html

## ordernow.html
My idea for this page is that it should be a form check-boxes for each dish to add to the order, and an ordernow button. For the order now button, instead of using the form buttons, we can create a block using div and padding etc, to make it look an appealing button and then hve it linked to a feedback page. Havent't done it yet.

## styles.css
A single CSS document for all the pages. All pages linked with this CSS file.

## Other details
All the image names, class names, id names are self-explanatory in my opinion.
The navigation bar code has been implemented using unordered list tags in all the pages to maintain uniformity.
I have also added a footer in all the pages, and set it's postion fixed to bottom.
All body and tables have been center aligned with font Times New Roman, and the width has been set to 100% (except for form, for which width was set to 90%)
For making all images equal-sized in the home page, I have fixed the image size using width and height.

Color distribution (as per the pallete you sent) used by me is as follows:
for background, the blue color.
for text, the white color.
for nav bar, and footer, the grey-black color.
and for the hovers, the black color.
